## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
Refer to [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.  
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Refer to [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more details.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.  
It gives you full control but is not reversible.
